Hi there, my name is Sander Holvoet. I am an Application Analyst working at [Picanol Group](http://www.picanolgroup.com/en/home#), mainly focusing on ERP and all things ALM. I am located in :belgium: Belgium.

I have a strong interest in automation, DevOps, cloud and technology in general. Whenever I'm not fixing <sub><sup>(or breaking)</sup></sub> stuff I like *good* :coffee:
coffee, :runner: running, :robot: [home automation](https://github.com/home-assistant) and :racing_car: F1.

I hope you found something interesting on this blog.<br/>
